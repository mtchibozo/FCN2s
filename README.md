This repo establishes a framework to build and train Single Shot Detector models for Table Structure Recognition.

I wrote this to implement the model defined in the DeepDeSRT paper from 2017 (https://www.dfki.de/fileadmin/user_upload/import/9672_PID4966073.pdf).

This allowed me to verify the results of the paper and recognize DeepDeSRT as a potential solution to the Table Extraction problem.

Main notebook is TchibNet-Training.ipynb
